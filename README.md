This paper investigates the ideas and methods of buoyancy modeling in computer graphics, emphasizing the approaches taken to reproduce fluid interactions and the difficulties in attaining computational efficiency and accuracy. Through an analysis of particle-based techniques, grid-based strategies, and real-time applications, this paper illustrates the progress and constraints in the field. Applications in animated movies and video games highlight how *buoyancy* is essential to producing realistic and engrossing landscapes.
